The Challenge
User Story 1 - Markets Index Page
As a visitor,
When I visit '/markets'
I see all markets listed with their name, city and state
When I click a button to see more info on that market
I'm taken to that market's show page '/markets/:id'

And I also see a list of all the Vendors that are at that market
Each vendor name is a link to that vendor's show page
